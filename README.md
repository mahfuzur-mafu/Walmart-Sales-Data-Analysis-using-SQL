## Project Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Download Walmart sales data using the Kaggle API.
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory for processing.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Load raw data into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.
   - Clean and preprocess the data by:
     - Removing duplicates.
     - Handling missing values.
     - Formatting currency and ensuring consistent data types.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Add calculated fields like total transaction amount (`unit_price * quantity`) for streamlined SQL analysis.

4. **Data Loading**
   - Load the cleaned data into MySQL and PostgreSQL databases using Python's `sqlalchemy`.

5. **SQL Querying**
   - Perform complex analyses to solve business problems, including:
     - Revenue trends by branch and category.
     - Identifying high- and low-performing products and branches.
     - Analyzing peak sales times and preferred payment methods.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Optionally, use visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib or Tableau) to present findings.
